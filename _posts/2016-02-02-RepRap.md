<p>RepRap (Replicating rapid prototyper)</p>

<p>The RepRap project started as a British initiative to develop a 3D printer that can print most of its own components and be low-cost 3D, but it is now made up of hundreds of collaborators word wide. So basically the RepRap is a general-purpose 3D printer that not only could be used to make structures and functional components for open-design projects but is an open-source project itself. An example of a RepRap is RecycleBot which is an open-source hardware device for converting waste plastic into filament for 3D printers like the RepRap. Making DIY 3D printer filament at home is both less costly and better for the environment than purchasing conventional 3D printer filament.- Team Parsnip</p>
