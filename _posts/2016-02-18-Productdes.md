---

<p> The Surge lamp is an open source design project to be downloaded, developed and modified constructed from laser cut poplar ply and powered by a simple arduino circuit and LEDâ€™s. </p> 

<p> The laser cut form made up of 36 individual slats placed around a center radius gives the effect of bent ply around its cylindrical structure without the effort of kerfing. </p>

<p> The light emitted from the Surge lamp is controlled by an untrasonic sensor, using movements of the hand the light can dimmed, brightened and turned on and off. </p>

<p> Its design has been considered as to include a wide range of makers; through simple design, minimal parts and straightforward assembly the Surge lamp can be made by many and is not limited to individuals with a design background. In this tutorial we have provided three different designs as straightforward illustrator files and step-by-step assembly instructions.</p> 

<p> We happily invite others to generate and transform the Surge lamp. Tom Reed, Kimi Moana Whiting, Alanah Bruce</p>
