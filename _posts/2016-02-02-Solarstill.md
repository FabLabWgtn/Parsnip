<p>By Gabriele Diamanti</p>
 
 <p>An open design project made so that local craftsman are able to upkeep it’s maintenance, taking advantage of their own readily available materials and native environments. The design incorporates both technical and traditional concepts making it very usable for the people it’s intended for.</p>

<p>It requires no fuel, filters or electricity and has zero impact on the environment and is made entirely from terracotta and zinc-plated metal sheets.</p>

<p>An example of open design used for social impact</p>
