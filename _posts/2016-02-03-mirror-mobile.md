<p>Elkeland, a Danish design studio created a series mirrored mobiles built from simple linear geometric shapes that reflect light within a space. They are designed to "interfere with the perception of space". </p>

<p>Materials of double-sided mirrored acrylic, brass sticks and beeswax-treated flax string are hand assembled into a small range of simple linear shapes, from ‘Halfmoons’ to ‘Ellipses’ and ‘Stairs’.<p/p>

<p>"Mirror mobiles provide a subtle play of light. With the particular composition of reflective materials, they suggest an altered perception on geometric shapes, space and surfaces." ," Elkeland founder/designer Ida Elke.</p/p>


<p>"I was interested in the way mirror interferes with the perception of space, particularly when it is in oblique angles."<p/p>

<p>While the Ellipse model is made up of only one shape, the Halfmoons and Stairs models come in two parts, and can be hung this mobile in several different ways due to the sliding intersection of the brass sticks.
