<p>	-A short video on some of the works of Alexander Calder
</p>

<p>Alexander Calder Born on August 22, 1898  was an American sculptor who was known for being the  original designer of the hanging mobile. The mobile is a type of moving sculpture made with delicately balanced and proportioned suspended shapes that move in response to touch or air currents .Calder was at the forefront of mobile design, his work transitioned from sculpture to wind mechanism to open design without the intentions at the start. Smart designs like these enable us to manipulate and personalise to suit briefs, individual preferences and overall shape desired.</p>
