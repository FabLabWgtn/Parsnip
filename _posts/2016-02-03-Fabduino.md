<p>Fabduino</p>

<p>Today we began milling and assembling our fabduino. We started by milling the areas that we needed removed which worked perfectly, however when it came to drilling the holes and cutting the board out we had some trouble. What happened was we remebered to switch the drill peices out but when it came to setting up the cut we did'nt work from left to right. Instead we skipped a very important element of the setup which meant the cut used the same drill depth as the traces and did'nt cut all the way through. We then had to go back and change the settings to cut properly.

When it came to setting up the Fabduino with all of it's components we had no trouble at all. This was because we had all of the components set up on a page with their names while also sticking down with double sided tape to stop them from blowing away. With a little bit of help from Fin in one of the other teams we had no problem getting all of the components down efficiently and quickly with all connections working perfectly!</p>
