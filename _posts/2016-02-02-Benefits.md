title: Benefits Of Design
---

<p>

Everyone can participate in open design as the software and hardware information is there to be replicated, adapted and developed, even by those with little experience. 

Non-designers can use open design to share their ideas and get feedback and information from those with more experience.

Designers can use open design as a way of testing ease of use or construction from potential users or constructors.

A way of inviting potential investors/ partners through sharing design and creating interest. They are able to test and improve the product and contact the original designer.

Can be utilized within singular organizations and small funded projects or can be used to focus on areas greatly needing development. 

Leaves ideas open to not only other designers but also the general public, allowing access to an extensive scope of knowledge, skills and ideas that would otherwise be limited to the designers. 

Open design allows for user modification, helping to ensure that products are fit for purposes or for individual users perception, reducing waste for physical goods. 

Downloadable content allows for development and production to occur locally or even by the individual, with the added environmental bonus of avoiding unnecessary transportation emissions and costs.
