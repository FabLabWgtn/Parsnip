<p>- Power switch / Light 
Concrete, organic glass, electronics (the simplest)</p>

<p>- This is an attempt to combine the power switch and lighting in a meaningful element of interior lighting. This light turns on and emerges (spring support) out of the wall by easily touching its cap. Turns off as well - click and close it. Diameter of the fixture may vary from 100-300mm, as well as height - 50-150mm. It can function in 150mm thick wall. The wall and the light is gorgeous and functional interior design element. Letâ€™s say - at a cafe table at home orover the cabinet.
