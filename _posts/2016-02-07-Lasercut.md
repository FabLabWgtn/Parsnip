<p>Shadows and Laser cutting:</p>

<p>When looking at the Kerf lamp some of the main attributes and designs that really stood out were not only the motion sensor but the lazer cutting and the shadows they emmitted. These patterns chosen for the kerf lamp are there for functionality and aesthetic. Using these designs in our own project will emphasise the idea and purpose of open design. Next steps would be to see how these work on a mobile like light and wither the shadows that emit are distinguised and work well with the overall end design. - TEAM PARSNIP</p>
