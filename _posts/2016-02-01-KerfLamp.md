[Kerf Lamp Source](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:206144)
<p> Kerf Lamp main attributes  
- Free standing lighting piece
- Sensor activated and controlled light with adjustable dimming
- Laser cut exterior creating a patterned shadow in the room
- Easily downloadable and modifiable
- Main material MDF 
- Form resembles side table/stool  
- Aesthetic qualities when not in use as a light 
- Simple design and construction </p>

<p> As a group we decided the Kerf Lamp would be our departure point for this project. Out of the three options it was the more refined design yet had aspects which were still open to development, reflecting the nature of open source design. We saw lighting as a rich form of design, with many opportunities in designing with physical form and electronics. </p>

<p>Main attributes we want to take from the Kerf lamp and apply to our design outcome: 
- Sensor activation
- Easily customizable through open design
- Aesthetic form when light is off
- Simple design and construction </p>
