<p>Babele Lamp</p>

<p>Their starting point was a classic abat-jour silhouette, which they played around with: disassembling it in plain sections, shuffling and putting them back in order, creating  and defining light gaps. The lamp that has resulted is like a giant wooden puzzle whose illuminating center shines through gaps in the puzzle pieces. Twist them around to create your own design.
