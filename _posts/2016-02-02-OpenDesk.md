<p>OpenDesk - A different approach to design.Furniture designed to be downloaded and made locally, Opendesk furniture is fast, affordable, sustainable and made on demand, just for you.OpenDesk works with companies to create unique workspace environments. Companies are choosing, personalising and adapting Opendesk designs to suit their unique brand and environment.“Opendesk is changing the way furniture is produced and moved, cutting out time-consuming and expensive shipping, showrooms and storage.”

“Opendesk is a little like GitHub, only instead of code, it offers furniture whose designs can be tweaked to individual specifications.” -Open Desk
