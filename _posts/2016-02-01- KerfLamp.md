<p> As a group we decided the Kerf lamp would be our other source of inspiration. Out of the three options the Kerf lamp seemed the most versatile and open to create and develop new and interesting ideas from it. As a group we want to utilise the same ideas that the Kerf lamp uses eg. Interaction,Light, and shape.-Team Parsnip  </p>
